                <h2>What Is Knights of The Old Republic?</h2>
                <p>
                  Knights of The Old Republic is a role-playing game set in
                  the Star Wars Universe developed by BioWare and published by
                  LucasArts in 2003. Set 4'000 years before the formation of the
                  Galactic Empire, Darth Malak, a Dark Lord of the Sith has unleashed a
                  Sith armada against the Galactic Republic. The player must venture to
                  different planets in the galaxy to defeat Malak, along the way
                  deciding the fate's of peoples of the planets they visit and,
                  ultimately, the galaxy as a whole. As the player makes decisions they
                  grow closer to the Light or Dark Side of the force, ultimately
                  deciding their role as a Jedi or Sith.

                  Knights of The Old Republic changed the landscape for
                  role-playing games setting new standards in game mechanics,
                  role-playing mechanics, player agency in story development and
                  character depth. It received critical acclaim upon release and
                  is often cited as one of the best video games ever made.
                  It has inspired numerous role-playing game franchises like
                  Mass Effect, Fallout, The Elder Scrolls and Pillars of Eternity.
