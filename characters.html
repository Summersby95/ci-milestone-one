                      wields a double sided yellow lightsaber. Identified
                      as a strong force user from an early age her mother
                      gave her up to the Jedi Order, despite Bastilla not

                    <p>
                      Carth Onasi, nicknamed Fleet, was a famous Human male
                      soldier and an expert pilot born in 3994 BBY on the
                      planet Telos IV, where he would later start a family
                      with his wife, Morgana; they had a son they named
                      Dustil. He served in the Republic Naval Starfighter
                      Corps, fighting for the Galactic Republic he loved
                      above all else in such conflicts as the Mandalorian
                      Wars against expanding Mandalorian clans, earning
                      several honors for his bravery during combat. During
                      the war, Onasi served under Admiral Saul Karath, who
                      would become his greatest ally and mentor. After the
                      war ended, Onasi planned to leave the Navy and return
                      to Telos to be with his family.

                      Carth's struggle to reconcile his anger about the loss
                      of his family and his hatred of the new Sith Empire that
                      he inadvertedly helped create is central to the plot
                      of KoToR.

                      HK-47 was a Hunter-Killer series assassin droid and Jedi
                      hunter constructed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth
                      Revan, shortly after the end of the Mandalorian Wars in
                      3960 BBY. In the wake of widespread destruction caused by
                      the Mass Shadow Generator, a superweapon used during the
                      final battle of that conflict, Revan was inspired to seek
                      more subtle methods of defeating his enemies. HK-47 was
                      sent throughout the galaxy on his missions and
                      successfully assassinated countless targets whom Revan
                      had deemed threats to galactic stability and peace.
                      However, HK-47 was badly crippled and captured on a
                      mission in Mandalorian space shortly before Revan himself
                      was captured by the Jedi Order.
