# Star Wars KOTOR Fan Page

The goal of this project is to provide a __Call to Arms__ for a Star Wars game series, _Knights of the Old Republic_, a series developed in the early 2000's that was then cancelled.

Today, remasters of games are very common and there is a devote group of Star Wars game fans who are dying for the two _Knights of the Old Republic_ games to get a remaster. The goal of this project is to rally this _cult's_ support and provide a form where they can petition EA, the company who own the right's to the Star Wars game franchise, to develop a remaster.
