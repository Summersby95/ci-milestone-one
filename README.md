# Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Petition Page

The goal of this project is to provide a __Call to Arms__ for a Star Wars game series, _Knights of the Old Republic_, a series developed in the early 2000's that was then cancelled.

Today, remasters of games are very common and there is a devote group of Star Wars game fans who are dying for the two _Knights of the Old Republic_ games to get a remaster. The goal of this project is to rally this _cult's_ support and provide a form where they can petition EA, the company who own the right's to the Star Wars game franchise, to develop a remaster.

### Design Choices
---

For this project I wanted the font and colours to replicate the colours and fonts found in the game. Below you can see an image from a dialogue interaction in the game. As you can see the text is coloured blue, with the highlighted option coloured yellow. I used [HTML Color Codes](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/) to upload a picture of the games dialogue and figure out the exact colours used. Having found my colours
